### What each project is about?
1. #### Bloom and Chill project;
    Fruit needs a good winter hybernation in order for produce high volume/quality fruits. Global warming is delaying the time of hybernation, and accelerating blooming season. These two are getting close to each other. What to do? Not have apple? or grow in in other regions? or?

 2. #### Codling Moth project;
     You may have noticed, even in the winter, if there is a time window of warm weather then insects show up; life cycle of these depend on accumulation of heat. Global Warming is causing them to reproduce more and changing their activity time window. They will eat apples. What to do? Not have apple? or grow in in other regions? or?

 3. #### Lagoon Over Flow;
     Global warming is causing precipitation to fall more in the form of rain. That will carry manure into the rivers and other water    resources. So, they need to know how to manage manure to keep the water clean!

 4. #### Finally, remote sensing and images
     Detect which fields are apple, cherry, pear, etc. Detect which fields are being used to double crop.
