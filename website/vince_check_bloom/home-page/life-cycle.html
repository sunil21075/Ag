<h4> <b> <u> Codling Moth Life cycle </u> </b> </h4>
<p>
The codling moth overwinters as a mature larva in a silk cocoon. In early spring, the overwintering larvae begin pupation, progress to the adult growth stage, mate, and lay eggs which hatch into larvae. In orchards, the larvae find and burrow into the fruit, usually within approximately one day after hatching. The larvae grow and mature in the fruit, coming out to build their cocoon and overwinter or pupate. And the cycle begins again. Each cycle is called a generation of the pest. In Washington State, we typically experience two full generations, and in some warm years a partial third generation of the codling moth.

<p>
Within each generation, a certain proportion of larvae pupate and start the next generation cycle. The rest go into a state of delayed development and inactivity (diapause induction). If these diapause-induced larvae reach full growth, they will overwinter successfully. Sometimes, the last generation diapause-induced larvae do not receive enough growing degree day accumulation to grow enough to successfully overwinter.
<br />
The fraction of larvae that are diapause-induced versus those that pupate is a function of the photoperiod or day length. When the days are shorter, a larger fraction of the larvae are diapause-induced for overwintering and a smaller fraction pupate into the next generation. When the days are longer, a smaller fraction is diapause-induced for overwintering, and a larger fraction pupates into the next generation.

<p>
Field measures at selected tree-fruit growing locations in Washington State helped develop an empirical relationship between day length and the percentage of larvae that were diapause-induced (or conversely, the percent that escaped diapause-induction and pupated). In Washington State, almost 100% of larvae are diapause-induced before mid-April and after late August. Diapause-induced larvae that emerged in August sometimes do not accumulate enough growing degree days to mature enough to overwinter successfully.

<p>
Codling moth growth is primarily temperature-driven, as is the case with cold-blooded insects in general. Degree day models have been used successfully in forecasting the timing of growth stages, and these models are commonly used to provide integrated pest management decision support such as through the WSU Tree-Fruit Decision Aid System (DAS). Our analyses are based on the degree day models for codling moth developed for and used in DAS.

<h4> <b> <u> Codling Moth Management Strategies </u> </b> </h4>
<p>
Codling moth management aims to disrupt three developmental stages: eggs, newly hatched larvae, and adults. Eggs can be prevented from hatching with topical or residual pesticides. Parasitoid wasps such as Trichogramma have also been shown to help suppress codling moth populations by attacking the egg stage. Newly hatched codling moth larvae can be targeted with residual pesticides or with the codling moth granulosis virus. Applications targeting the newly hatched larvae need to be timed perfectly, because the larvae enter the safety of the fruit within a day of hatching. Finally, mating disruption is directed at the adult codling moths. It delays and prevents mating and, thus, leads to a substantial reduction of eggs laid in the orchard. Management programs combine these strategies in one way or another to keep fruit damage below the economic threshold.
